## The thin evidence behind the most undebatable medical question: do vaccines cause autism?

Presidential candidate RFK Jr is being censored heavily in mainstream media because whe questions vaccine safety and sometimes almost asserts that vaccines cause autism.
Many vaccine scientists, e.g. Peter Hotez, whose almost every confident claim about Covid was proven incorrect over time, have claimed that the question of whether vaccines cause autism is not even worth debating.
Given their extreme convidence, you would think they have excellent evidence to back up their claims.
In this article, I first critically analyze the evidence they themself put forward to claim that the question is settled science. Then, I critically analyze the evidence of the opposite side.
Although I highly recommend you read the whole article yourself and come to your own conclusions, my takeaway is that the evidence to resolve this question is incredibly weak: many medical scientists would see immediately that the evidence is too weak if the vaccine was a drug, but somehow the word "vaccine" turns off their critical thinking abilities.
Finally, I sketch trials designs that can answer the question of vaccines causing autism or other autoimmune disorders with much more centainty.


Disclaimer: My evidence review is by no means comprehensive: the published medical literature on vaccines is huge. Also, this article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

## evidence review: vaccines dont cause autism
Two of the most vocal vaccine advocates are Peter Hotez and Paul Offit.
Paul Offit published [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26417097/) which he claims to settle
the question.
Similar evidence has also been used by Peter Hotez. e.g. in his [book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Vaccines_Did_Not_Cause_Rachel_s_Autism.html?id=NkpyDwAAQBAJ) and many other even much more rigorous scientists
to proudly say that they disagree with RFK Jr on childhood vaccines (even though they agree on Covid vaccines and FDA/CDC capture), e.g. [here](https://www.thefp.com/p/what-rfk-jr-gets-rightand-what-he) and [here](https://twitter.com/TracyBethHoeg/status/1670591104654381057).
Below, I consider one by one the evidence they present.

### retrospective observational studies: MMR and autism
There are several studies RETROSPECTIVELY comparing the rates of autism in those who got MMR and those who didn't. Most vaccine evangelists point to these papers first when making the claim that vaccines do not cause autism.
For example, in the section titled "Childhood Vaccines Cause Autism: Got it Wrong", Dr. Vinay Prasad only provides [this paper](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m18-2101) and a similar earlier paper from 2015 as evidence. We will look at the 2019 paper in detail.

Before that, lets make it clear that even if MMR does not cause autism -- and I think it doesnt -- it doesnt mean that the battery of the total ~20 doses infants get together doesnt cause autism. It is not just about magnitude: most other vaccines in today's vaccine schedule work very differently.
MMR is a live virus vaccine: the virus in it infects the human body and replicates just
like any other virus would: it just has been modified/attenuated to not cause the disease that the actual Measles virus may cause in children.
But it is similar enough to the actual measles virus that the antibodies that the body develops against the vaccine version are effective in combating the actual measles virus: very cool technology.
Our bodies have evolved to fight such infections from live/replicating viruses. Decades of research has shown that the human immune system generalizes what it learns from the MMR vaccine and likely also prevent other diseases: these are now called non-specific benefits of vaccines.
Unfortunately, most of the vaccines in use today are not live vaccines.
There is a concern that the virus in a live vaccine can mutate and regain its ability to cause disease: a phenomenon that actually happened with the polio vaccine, although not with MMR and other live vaccines.
Most vaccines today have either the killed virus or just parts (e.g. proteins) of the killed virus: e.g. HepB, IPV, HPV, flu vaccine (not flu mist). The body usually does not know what to do with dead viruses alone and does not mount a good enough immune response
Scientists figured out that by including some some toxin, e.g. aluminium, thimerosal, to kill a small number of cells at the injection site in the muscle, the body can be forced to mount a much better response.
All dead virus vaccines have such adjuvants.
Unfortunately, the same group that showed that live vaccines likely have non-specific beneficial effects ALSO showed that dead virus vaccines likely have non-specific deleterious effects, which we will look into later in this article.
For now, the point is that even if MMR does not cause autism, you canNOT claim that childhood vaccines do not cause autism.
Nevertheless, lets look anyway at whether the evidence for even MMR not causing autism meets the standards the same scientists use in other circumstances, e.g. whether Ivermectin prevents Covid.


#### pitfalls in using retrospective observational studies to prove/disprove causality

### mechanistic studies of suspicious components of vaccines

### animal trials of the full vaccine schedule

### human RCTs or lack thereof

## evidence review: vaccines cause autism
### observational studies
### aluminium in brains
## evidence of other harms of vaccines
### DTP natural experiment
### atopic dermatitis: schedule vs delayed vaccination

## Trials/Studies to generate better evidence of vaccine safety
first define a very objectice criteria for diagnosing autism
### Prospective studies of vaccinated vs compltetely unvaccinated children
### RCTs of vaccinated vs compltetely unvaccinated children
do we have enough parents who are so much on the fence that they agree to abide by the coin toss?
how large do the trials need to be?

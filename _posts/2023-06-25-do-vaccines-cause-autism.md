## The thin evidence behind the most undebatable medical question: do vaccines cause autism?

Presidential candidate RFK Jr is being censored heavily in mainstream media because whe questions vaccine safety and sometimes almost asserts that vaccines cause autism.
Many vaccine scientists, e.g. Peter Hotez, whose almost every confident claim about Covid was proven incorrect over time, have claimed that the question of whether vaccines cause autism is not even worth debating.
Given their extreme convidence, you would think they have excellent evidence to back up their claims.
In this article, I first critically analyze the evidence they themself put forward to claim that the question is settled science. Then, I critically analyze the evidence of the opposite side.
Although I highly recommend you read the whole article yourself and come to your own conclusions, my takeaway is that the evidence to resolve this question is incredibly weak: many medical scientists would see immediately that the evidence is too weak if the vaccine was a drug, but somehow the word "vaccine" turns off their critical thinking abilities.
Finally, I sketch trials designs that can answer the question of vaccines causing autism or other autoimmune disorders with much more centainty.
Disclaimer: My evidence review is by no means comprehensive: the published medical literature on vaccines is huge. Also, this article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

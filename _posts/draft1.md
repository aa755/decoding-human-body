# Hypotheses

## loosening Covid restrictions

Diwali (November 2020): https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1326544616426909697

Makar Sakranti (January 2021): https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/01/1610700764_makar-sankranti-8-e1610700886767.jpg?impolicy=website&width=0&height=0

political rallies, maha kumbh in March-April 2021

why did it happen only in April 2021?

## vaccination process & termporary immunosupression after vaccination

some of them were indoors. some were outdoors. not clear what %
hurts 2 ways: immune supressed towards Covid. immune suppressed towards other diseases that may be circulating, possibly due to inactivation, possibly due to opportunistic actions.
### why not seen in trials
- different population?: is there an Covishield RCT on Indian population?
- different disease dynamics: during the trial, the subjects were mostly independent/isolated but when vaccinating at a population level, the dependent dynamics (e.g. increased transmission among vaccinnes) may happen. no trial has measured the efficacy of Covid vaccines in reducing preventing *asymptomatic* infections and reducing transmission of infections by vacinnees. So many people were getting infected after vaccination (some of my friends who got Pfizer in the US and then travelled to India got infected) that even many mainstream media articles suggested the possibility of asymptomatic spread https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/many-catching-virus-after-1st-jab-turning-silent-spreaders-docs/articleshow/82489543.cms?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=TOIDesktop

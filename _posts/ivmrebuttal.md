that facebook slaped on the very accurate and nuanced review of Ivermectin by Dr Tess Laurie:

"independent fact checkers" are unhappy that her paper is not peer reviewed. peer review is neither necessary nor sufficient 
for  validity of a document: these days, especially in health/medicine, 
its most important utility is perhaps in being a sign of existing biases: see the nature (perhaps the most 
respected journal) paper from last year completely dismissing the lab-leak hypothesis, or the Lancet-published fraudulent 
surgispere study dismissing hydroxychloroquine:
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext
(the paper has passed peer review and has been published in the American Journal of Therapeutics 
doi: 10.1097/MJT.0000000000001402)

The fact check complains about the subjective endpoints in Ivermectin papers, when the 
video talks about reduction of deaths, arguably the most objective and most important efficacy metric.

The fact check is concerned about statistical significance when the video clearly shows that when combining all studies 
(meta-analysis, which is regarded as the gold standard for making recommendations), 
the reduction in deaths is statistically significant.

The fact check is concerned about the high dose used in the test-tube viral replication reduction study, when a recent HUMAN 
RCT from Israel shows that even the dose actually being used in many countries is effective in reducing viral load:

The fact-check claims suggests we should ignore all the trials where the intervention was not blinded 
between an intervention and placebo group, because of the placebo effect. 
The placebo effect is indeed a problem for trials designed to measure subjective outcomes like pain-reduction. 
But very objective and hard outcomes, e.g. death, which this video is about, are much less prone to such biases. 
Until we have large blinded trials to evaluate reduction in deaths -- of which there are NONE -- 
these Randomzed Controlled Trials (RCTs) provide a very useful signal about the causal effects 
of ivermectin on deaths when given to patients with knowledge of what they are getting, as it happens in real life. 
Doing blinded trials can be very hard in a pandemic setting when people are dying in hospitals, where the main priority is to 
save lives, and doing irrefutable trials is a secondary priority, unlike prevention trials like the vaccine trials.
It's also worth pointing out the double standard here. Masks were mandated. Where is the double-blind RCT showing that it is 
effective. You cant even do a blind RCT for masks (people cant wear masks and not know it). 
The only RCT (Danish trial, n=4000) of masks for Covid could not find any statistically significant benefit of masks.
Many of the claims (e.g. prevention of transmission, prevention of ASYMPTOMATIC infections) confidently being made about 
mrna vaccines do NOT even have unblinded RCTs supporting them and thus they suffer from even bigger problems 
like possible confounding: the possibility of health-conciuous people being overrepresented in the vaccinated group. 
(this is not to undermine the importance of vaccines: they have great evidence about reducing symptomatic infections. But 
ivermectin is needed for the infections that happen until/despite global vaccination: even the US as 1000s of vaccine 
breakthrough cases, 2% of which are fatal https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-05-25/2-percent-of-breakthrough-
infections-cause-covid-deaths-cdc)

The fact check argues that we should only look at the Lopez-Medina trial because "SOME of the other trials had no blinded 
(placebo) controls". ALONE, just like many other Ivermectin-for-covid RCTs, this trial was too small to measure a 
statistically-significant reduction in deaths (0 deaths in Ivermectin arm, 1 in control). It is incorrect to conflate "too 
small to measure statistically-significant reduction in deaths" with "ineffective in reducing deaths". It is also incorrect 
to cherry-pick just one trial: there were many other RCTs, which the video reviews.
(also some have raised other unreliability concerns about the Lopez-Medina trial https://osf.io/u7ewz , 
but I haven't tried to verify them.)

The fact check claims that the video disregards recent negative evidence without explicitly specifying which one.
On the contrary, the video spends quite a lot of time on the Lopez-Medina trial, 
which the fact-check INCORRECTLY promotes as the main negative evidence (see prev. paragraph). 

The fact-check claims that Juan Chamie has no biology or medicine training. 
Why is that even relevant? This video is by Tess Laurie, a medical doctor who also has a PhD in medicine. 
Also, the fact check cites what FDA/WHO/CDC believe as authorities on the subject. 
Sorry, appeal to authority has no place in science. 
You need to evaluate the argument, not the credentials of who said it.

The fact-check raises a legitmate concern about safety but again wrongly uses a double standard: it is true that a drug 
that is otherwise very safe may worsen a new disease, although such a possibility seems to be very unlikely.
Also, no drug/vaccine is 100% safe. Where are the trials used to recommend 
paracetamol/tylenol/acetaminophen and NSAIDs like ibuprofen when the pandemic started? 
A drug (oral Ivermectin) that has been distributed at a population level (to billions of people) for decades to prevent river 
blindness and has been prescribed even to kids for decades (e.g. for head lice, scabies), 
has much better safety evidence than the mrna vaccines which has not even been studied in humans for more than a few months. 
In contrast, dexamethasone, which the experts actually recommend based on 1-month safety evidence in a Covid-specific RCT, 
turned out to be suspected to cause deadly fungal infections in India in the longer term. 
Pre-covid, it was ALREADY known that mechanistically, steroids like dexamethasone 
temporarily "slows down" the immune system, and may cause increased susceptibility to infections.
